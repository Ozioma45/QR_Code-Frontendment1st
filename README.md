### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media query


### Continued development

The media query was quite challenging. Confusing at first. I would really love to build and learn more about it in my future projects for a better reponsiveness in my projects.

### Useful resources

- [W3school](https://www.W3school.com) - This helped me for achieving my media query. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
